# Migration Plan: From Claude+RAG to Basic Groq Chatbot

## Overview (For Beginners)

This plan will help you convert your current complex GenAI Assistant (which uses Claude AI + RAG + Pinecone) into a simple chatbot using Groq instead. 

**What you currently have:**
- Claude 3.5 Sonnet AI model (from Anthropic)
- RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) - searches documents to answer questions
- Pinecone vector database for storing document embeddings
- Complex streaming responses

**What you'll get:**
- Simple Groq-powered chatbot (Groq is faster and often cheaper)
- Direct question → answer flow (no document searching)
- Cleaner, simpler codebase
- Still with streaming responses for good user experience

## Step-by-Step Migration Plan

### Phase 1: Setup Groq
1. **Get Groq API Key**
   - Go to https://groq.com
   - Sign up and get your API key
   - Add to your `.env.local` file: `GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here`

2. **Install Groq SDK**
   ```bash
   npm install groq-sdk
   ```

### Phase 2: Replace Core AI Logic
3. **Create New Groq Service** (`lib/groqChat.ts`)
   - Replace the complex RAG logic in `lib/ragChain.ts`
   - Simple function that takes user message, sends to Groq, returns response
   - Support streaming for real-time responses

4. **Update API Route** (`app/api/chat/route.ts`)
   - Remove RAG-related imports and logic
   - Remove document searching functionality
   - Keep streaming response structure but use Groq instead of Claude

### Phase 3: Simplify Frontend
5. **Update Chat Interface** (`components/ChatInterface.tsx`)
   - Remove any RAG-specific UI elements
   - Keep the core chat functionality
   - Ensure streaming still works with new backend

### Phase 4: Clean Up
6. **Remove Unused Files and Dependencies**
   - Remove `lib/pinecone.ts` (vector database logic)
   - Remove `app/api/documents/route.ts` (document upload endpoint)
   - Uninstall Pinecone and OpenAI dependencies if not needed
   - Update `package.json`

7. **Update Environment Variables**
   - Remove `PINECONE_API_KEY` and `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` references
   - Update `.env.example` with only `GROQ_API_KEY`

8. **Update Documentation**
   - Update `CLAUDE.md` to reflect new simple architecture
   - Update README.md with Groq setup instructions

### Phase 5: Testing
9. **Test the New Chatbot**
   - Verify basic chat functionality works
   - Test streaming responses
   - Check error handling
   - Test deployment on Vercel

## Technical Details (For Implementation)

### New File Structure
```
lib/
├── groqChat.ts          # New: Simple Groq chat logic (replaces ragChain.ts)
└── pinecone.ts          # DELETE: Remove vector database logic

app/api/
├── chat/route.ts        # MODIFY: Use Groq instead of Claude+RAG
└── documents/route.ts   # DELETE: Remove document upload functionality
```

### Dependencies to Remove
```bash
npm uninstall @pinecone-database/pinecone openai
```

### Dependencies to Add
```bash
npm install groq-sdk
```

### Environment Variables
**Remove:**
- `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
- `PINECONE_API_KEY`  
- `OPENAI_API_KEY`

**Add:**
- `GROQ_API_KEY`

## Benefits of This Migration

✅ **Simpler Architecture**: No more complex RAG pipeline  
✅ **Faster Responses**: Groq is known for speed  
✅ **Lower Costs**: Groq is often more cost-effective  
✅ **Easier Maintenance**: Less code to maintain  
✅ **Better for Learning**: Easier to understand how it works  

## What You'll Lose

❌ **Document Search**: Can't search through uploaded documents  
❌ **Context Awareness**: Won't remember document content  
❌ **RAG Capabilities**: No retrieval-augmented generation  

## Estimated Time
- **Total time**: 2-4 hours
- **Skill level**: Beginner-friendly (with some guidance)
- **Complexity**: Low (removing complexity, not adding it)

## Next Steps
1. Read through this entire plan
2. Backup your current code (`git commit -am "backup before groq migration"`)
3. Start with Phase 1 (getting Groq API key)
4. Work through each phase step by step
5. Test thoroughly after each phase

## Need Help?
If you get stuck at any step:
1. Check the Groq documentation: https://console.groq.com/docs
2. Look at the original files to understand what they do before changing them
3. Test each change before moving to the next step
4. Keep your git history clean with regular commits

This migration will give you a much simpler, faster chatbot that's perfect for learning and basic use cases!
